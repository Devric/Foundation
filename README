Starting Foudation Mono Repo

- Demo SSR: React.TS SSR with vite and tailwind
- @TODO SPA
- @TODO StoryBook UI
- Web3 project
- hardhat repo
- EDA microservices with kafka/rabbitmq

## Tips
- Local Ignore:  echo YOURFILE_OR_DIRECTOY >> .git/info/exclude 

		exclude file is the same as .gitignore, however it will not be pushed to the central repo
		after pulling work repos eg: apps/workApp, you can ignore it from the foundation exclude and have a separete git repo
